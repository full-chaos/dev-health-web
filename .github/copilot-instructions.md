# Copilot / Agent Instructions

Read `AGENTS.md` in the repository root before taking action — it is the source of truth for architecture, flows, diagrams, and agent behavior.

High level rules

- Make minimal, surgical changes.
- Run or update tests for changed code.
- Avoid committing secrets; use environment variables in examples.

If unsure: open an issue instead of guessing behavior.
